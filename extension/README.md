Progressive Web Apps for Firefox - Extension
============================================

The extension part of the PWAsForFirefox project.

## Description

The extension part of the project makes it easier to install and manage Progressive Web Apps directly from the main Firefox browser. It supports installing supported PWAs with just a few clicks, managing and launching them, and creating and managing app profiles directly from the UI.

Read [the main README file](../README.md) for more details about the project.

## Installation

### From Addon Store

It is recommended to install the extension from [the Firefox Add-ons website](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/pwas-for-firefox/).

### From Development Artifacts

You can download and install [the latest build artifact](https://github.com/filips123/PWAsForFirefox/actions/workflows/extension.yaml) from GitHub Actions builds.

Note that these are development versions that may be unstable and are not signed, so you will need to configure Firefox to accept non-signed extensions or just load it temporarily. It is generally not recommended to use them, unless you are testing a specific unreleased feature.

### From Source

1. Install Node.js and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager using [`corepack`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/corepack.html):

   ```bash
   corepack enable
   ```

2. Clone the repository and cd into the `extension` (this) directory.

3. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
